# Weather Trend Forecasting

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing weather trends and forecasting future weather patterns using machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of historical weather data, which is processed and used to train models that predict temperature, humidity, and other weather-related factors.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Time series forecasting using machine learning models
- Performance evaluation of forecasting models

## Requirements
To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook `WeatherTrendForecasting.ipynb`.
2. Follow the step-by-step implementation to load the dataset, preprocess the data, and train the forecasting models.
3. Evaluate model performance and visualize predictions.

## Dataset
- The dataset contains historical weather data including:
  - Temperature
  - Humidity
  - Wind Speed
  - Precipitation
- Ensure the dataset is properly formatted before running the notebook.

## Results
- Model evaluation is based on metrics like RMSE and MAE.
- Visualizations of forecasted trends vs. actual data.

## Future Enhancements
- Incorporate additional weather parameters.
- Optimize hyperparameters for better accuracy.
- Deploy as a web application for real-time predictions.
